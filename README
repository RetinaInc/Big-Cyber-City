Big Cyber City is a basic social network implemented in Java. It uses
many open source libraries and runs on Tomcat.

My primary purpose for creating this web application was to learn Java
back when I was in college. It is not production ready, but I believe
it serves as good example code for how to use some of the popular open
source libraries.

You can see this site in action by going to
http://bigcybercity.com. However, I am not actively maintaining the site
but rather leaving it up for my portfolio.

The code comes with a BSD license. See the LICENSE file for details.

Prerequisites
- You must have Java, Tomcat and Mysql installed. 
- BCC depends on many open source libraries, including Spring, DWR,
Hibernate, and more. 

Installation
- Create the database on MySql using the file BCC.sqll
- Clone the repository.
- Modify the files BCC-data.xml, build.xml, build.properties and
bcc.properties accordingly.
- Install referenced libraries in the list at the end of this file.
- At this point the project should build properly. You can modify the
build script to your liking. It comes with code to automatically
deploy to a local tomcat directory and restart tomcat.
- The "static" and "photos" directories are not meant to be served
from tomcat but rather a static web server, such as nginx.
